# Draw Messenger Frontend â†’

This is a front-end project for a chatting application with text/drawings chat feature, built using React and Socket.IO client. The application allows users to communicate with each other by sending text messages and also provides a drawing canvas where users can collaborate by drawing together in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time text messaging: Users can send and receive text messages in real-time.
- Drawing canvas: Users can collaborate and draw together on a shared canvas.
- Multiple users: The application supports multiple users and allows them to chat and draw simultaneously.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Socket.IO client: A JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the browser and the server.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Version 14 or above.
- npm: Package manager for Node.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```

5. The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000. Open this URL in your web browser.

## Configuration

The application requires a WebSocket server to handle the real-time communication. By default, it assumes the server is running at http://localhost:8000. If your server is running on a different address or port, you can modify the configuration in the src/utils/socket.js file.
